# WatchDiver Manual

> Mirror of the WatchDiver in-app Manual page — generated from the app sources (`swift run generate-manual`), published for reading on the phone via the QR code on the watch. Do not edit here; it is updated from the main repository.

## Read me first

WatchDiver is a SECONDARY DISPLAY, not a certified dive computer (no EN 13319, no redundancy). Always dive with an independent, certified dive computer and follow it and your training. If the two displays disagree, the certified computer wins — every time. Test each build with a demo dive (“Try it”, below) on land before taking it near water.

## The five pages

Turn the Digital Crown to change pages. Underwater the touchscreen is water-locked; everything is readable by glance, nothing needs a tap. The ring shows only pages that currently mean something: while diving (armed or submerged) it is Dive and Tissues; at the surface, Settings and Manual are always there, the Logbook joins once it holds a dive, and Tissues stays visible while your tissues carry loading from a dive.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **1 · Dive** | The main display: depth, time, gas, and the one operative instruction (NDL, stop, or a directive). |
| **2 · Tissues** | 16 bars, one per tissue compartment (fast → slow), each as % of its surface M-value. Long bars = loaded tissue. The header shows the live GF and ppO₂. |
| **3 · Logbook** | Saved dives, newest first. Swipe a dive left to delete it; swipe right to save it to Apple Health or to share it as a UDDF file. |
| **4 · Settings** | Gas, gradient factors, water type, altitude. Surface only — locked during the dive. |
| **5 · Manual** | This reference, the demo dives under “Try it”, and a QR code that opens this manual on your phone. |

## Starting a dive

Press DIVE on the READY screen before entering the water — that is the deterministic path: the depth sensor and the background session are armed, and Water Lock engages the moment you submerge. Automatic starts exist as a safety net, not as the plan.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **First start** | On its first launch WatchDiver asks for the depth-sensor permission and offers the Auto-Launch setup — on dry land, because the permission dialog cannot be answered once Water Lock owns the screen. |
| **DIVE button** | Arms the dive before you enter the water. After opening, the app stays in front for 30 minutes — enough preparation time. Leave the Digital Crown alone once armed: unlocking Water Lock ends the background session. |
| **Auto-start (app in front)** | If WatchDiver is on screen when you submerge below 1 m, the dive starts by itself — the watch hands the app a dive session automatically. |
| **Auto-Launch (app closed)** | Which dive app opens on submersion is a watch setting: Settings → General → Auto-Launch → When Submerged. Select WatchDiver there — otherwise Apple's Depth app takes the dive. Developer-installed builds can be missing from that list (a known watchOS bug); then always start the dive from the app before entering the water. |
| **One dive session only** | The watch runs a single dive session at a time. Whichever app starts it owns the dive; WatchDiver and the Depth app never run one simultaneously. |
| **Session ended mid-dive** | If the watch kills the depth session while the workout net still carries the app, WatchDiver re-arms silently (the event goes to the diagnostics log). A red message appears only when the underwater runtime is actually lost — then keep WatchDiver in front, or reopen it. |
| **Ending a dive** | Surfacing ends the dive by itself: the log page appears, the background sessions end and the armed state clears — no button needed. The next dive starts with DIVE again (or automatically if you re-submerge); tissue loading carries over. Cancel exists only for an armed dive that never went below 1 m. |
| **Health permission** | The first DIVE start asks for Health workout access: the dive keeps the app alive underwater as an open-water swim workout session. The session itself writes nothing to Health — only an explicit dive export does. |
| **Ending a dive** | A dive ends after 60 seconds continuously at the surface. Briefly breaking the surface — wave chop, a quick look around — does not end or split the dive; the log records the moment you finally surfaced. |

## Dive display, top to bottom

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **TEMP · DIVE · GAS** | Water temperature (°C), time since submerging (m:ss), breathing gas. |
| **DEPTH** | Current depth in metres — the biggest number on screen, and the one that rules. |
| **▲ / ▼ n** | Vertical speed in m/min (▲ ascending, ▼ descending). Green ≤ 9, amber near 10, red above 12. |
| **MAX** | Deepest point of this dive (m). |
| **GF n %** | Live surfacing gradient factor: how close the most loaded tissue would be to its Bühlmann limit if you surfaced now. 100 % = on the raw limit. |
| **CEIL** | Direct-ascent ceiling (m), shown only in deco: do not ascend shallower than this right now. |
| **Operative card** | Exactly one instruction at a time: the NDL countdown, or the first deco stop, or a red directive — never two at once. |

## Screens and colours

Colour is never the only signal — every state also changes its text. Teal = fine, amber = caution, red = act now. The background tints with depth and floods amber/red with severity.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **READY** | At the surface, before a dive: gas, GF, sensor limit, plus the DIVE button (demo dives live on the Manual page). The teal GAS and GF cells open their setting directly; LIMIT is the sensor's statement, not a choice. Notices (restored tissue state, no-fly) appear here. |
| **Teal depth** | Inside the NDL, comfortably. Nothing to do but enjoy. |
| **▲ ASCEND SOON (amber)** | NDL at or below 5 min: begin the ascent soon or accept a deco obligation. |
| **DECOMPRESSION (amber badge)** | Direct ascent no longer allowed. The card shows the first stop (depth · minutes) and TTS. Ascend to the stop, never above it. |
| **▲ ABOVE STOP — DESCEND (red)** | You are shallower than a mandatory stop: descend below the stop depth immediately. Pulsing red background, repeating strong buzz. |
| **SLOW — ASCENT TOO FAST** | Ascending faster than 12 m/min. Full-screen takeover: slow down until it disappears (target ≤ 10 m/min). |
| **ASCEND — PAST SENSOR LIMIT** | At/past the sensor's maximum depth. Depth data is unreliable from here — ascend. Warned in amber from 90 % of the limit (“NEAR x m SENSOR LIMIT”). |
| **SAFETY STOP ring** | Advisory 3-min hold at 5 m after dives beyond 10 m. The ring shows the countdown and your live depth — hold it near 5 m. A mandatory deco stop always wins the screen; after a deco dive the countdown starts once the last mandatory stop is cleared (do the safety stop anyway — recommended practice). Success buzz when done. |
| **Dive Log** | After surfacing: profile sparkline, max depth, dive time, min temperature, end GF, running surface interval, and the no-fly estimate. |

## Vibrations

Three levels, matching the colours:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Single tap** | Caution: NDL warning reached, or approaching the sensor depth limit. |
| **Distinct prompt** | State change into mandatory decompression. |
| **Strong, repeating buzz** | Act now — above a mandatory stop, ascending too fast, or past the sensor limit. It repeats until the situation is corrected. |
| **Success pattern** | Safety stop completed — clear to surface (advisory). |

## Warnings and honesty

A visible failure beats a plausible wrong number. These lines can appear at the bottom of the dive display or on READY:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Plan truncated — do not trust** | The deco plan could not be computed to the end. Treat displayed values as broken; dive your certified computer. |
| **n sensor readings dropped** | Invalid sensor samples were rejected (they never touch the model). A handful is normal noise; many = scrutinize the whole profile. |
| **PAST MOD x m — ppO₂ HIGH** | Deeper than the configured gas's MOD: oxygen toxicity risk. Ascend above the MOD. |
| **Tissue loading restored…** | The app was restarted and resumed the saved tissue state, off-gassed across the gap. Normal after closing the app between dives. |
| **Restored after an interrupted dive — estimate degraded** | The app went down mid-dive; the gap was bridged conservatively by assumption. Trust only the certified computer for the rest of the day. |
| **Depth sensor fault** | The watch itself flagged its depth reading as unreliable. The display can no longer be trusted for this dive. |

## Abbreviations

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **NDL** | No-Decompression Limit: minutes you can stay at this depth and still ascend straight to the surface. Displayed floored (5.9 shows 5), capped at 99+. |
| **GF (settings)** | Gradient Factors low/high (e.g. 45/85): how far into the Bühlmann tolerance the plan may go — at the deepest stop (low) and at the surface (high). Smaller = more conservative = longer stops. |
| **TTS** | Time To Surface: minutes for the full ascent including all deco stops. |
| **FIRST STOP** | Deepest mandatory deco stop, as depth · minutes. This is the floor that must not be crossed while it shows. |
| **MOD** | Maximum Operating Depth of the gas: deeper than this, oxygen partial pressure exceeds 1.4 bar (toxicity risk). Each gas row in Settings shows its MOD. |
| **EAN** | Enriched Air Nitrox; EAN32 = 32 % oxygen. More O₂ = longer NDL but shallower MOD. |
| **ppO₂** | Oxygen partial pressure in bar. Recreational working limit: 1.4. |
| **LIMIT** | The depth sensor's maximum operating depth (40 m on this hardware/entitlement). Beyond it the watch's depth data is unreliable. |
| **NO FLY** | Model estimate of the wait before flying (0.75 bar cabin). Read as “at least”: DAN guidelines (12 h after one no-deco dive, 18 h after repetitive dives) apply independently. |
| **END GF** | Surfacing gradient factor at the moment you left the water — the log's “how close was that” number. |
| **SURFACE INTERVAL** | Time since surfacing. Tissues keep off-gassing in the model, so a repetitive dive starts correctly pre-loaded. |
| **UDDF** | Universal Dive Data Format — the open XML interchange format desktop logbooks (e.g. Subsurface) and dive-log websites read. Swipe a logbook dive right to share it as a .uddf file from the watch. |
| **QR code** | On the Manual page, under “Read on the phone”: point the iPhone camera at it to open this manual (MANUAL.md) in the browser — for comfortable reading on a bigger screen. Needs internet on the phone; the watch itself never does. |

## Settings, explained

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Gas** | Air or nitrox preset. Changing gas keeps your tissue loading — safe to switch between repetitive dives. Check the MOD shown per gas. |
| **Gradient factors** | 30/70 conservative → 50/95 aggressive. When in doubt, keep 45/85 or ask your instructor. Lower numbers = earlier, longer stops. |
| **Water** | Salt (default) or fresh. The depth sensor is calibrated for salt water; in fresh water the same pressure means a slightly greater depth, so WatchDiver corrects the displayed depth (~2 % deeper). Tissue loading follows the measured pressure and is unaffected. |
| **Altitude** | For mountain-lake diving; sets the surface pressure (shown per preset). Mountain lakes are fresh water — set Water to Fresh as well. Assumes you are already acclimatized at the site — arriving and diving immediately makes the model optimistic. |
| **Locked during the dive** | Settings only work at the surface, by design — no configuration surprises underwater. |

## Watch-face complication

WatchDiver can live on your watch face (add it like any complication when editing a face). Between dives it shows what you would otherwise open the app for; one tap opens WatchDiver. It is a mirror of the app's last computed state — the same “at least” framing applies, and demo dives never appear on the face.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **NO FLY ≥ n h (face)** | Counts down to the model-estimated clear moment, hours rounded up. Read as “at least” — DAN's fixed minimums (12 h / 18 h) apply independently, exactly like the in-app card. |
| **SI (face)** | Surface interval: running time since you left the water (shown for the first 24 h). |
| **DIVE / READY (face)** | No dive recent, nothing to count down: the complication is a launcher showing your configured gas and GF. |

## Demo dives (Try it)

Both demos run on a separate, sandboxed model — your real tissue state, logbook and recovery snapshot stay untouched, guaranteed. The display is the production dive screen, and the vibrations are real: learning the haptic vocabulary is the point. Never start a demo in the water.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Interactive demo** | You are the depth profile: the Digital Crown sets the depth, and time runs at ×60 (1 s of real time = 1 min of dive time). Turning the crown up n metres within one second ascends at n m/min — provoke the NDL warning, deco, a stop violation, SLOW, the sensor limit, the safety stop, then hold 0 m to surface and see the log and no-fly. |
| **Guided demo** | Hands-free autoplay of a complete deco dive (30 m, stops, safety band, log) — the walkthrough mode for a dive-school briefing. |
| **DEMO ×60 badge** | Always visible during a demo, so a demo screen can never be mistaken for a live dive. Demo sessions have no DIVE button. |

## The model, in one breath

Bühlmann ZH-L16C with gradient factors (Erik Baker): 16 theoretical nitrogen compartments load and unload exponentially; the display warns when the most loaded one approaches its tolerated limit. It models an average body — it knows nothing about cold, exertion, dehydration or your physiology. That is one of the reasons this app must stay a secondary display.
